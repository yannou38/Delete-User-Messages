# Delete-User-Messages
Delete every message of a user on a discord server.

Took the script from [here](https://gist.github.com/z861gz6wb2/fd89c6cf9db9662c68698736d937f0d2) then edited it to use discord search API to get messages in the whole server from the user using this script.

You have to fill the guildID (= server ID) yourself. search on google how to do it
